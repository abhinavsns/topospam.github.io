TopoSPAM (Topological Simulation Platform for Active Matter) is a cutting-edge simulation software package specifically designed to facilitate the study of morphogenesis and biological active matter, two pivotal areas of biology with significant implications for clinical medicine. This software addresses a rising demand for more dynamic and flexible models that are capable of simulating anatomical or cellular subsystems in a manner that is customizable and adaptive. Traditional simulation approaches often rely on fixed, pre-defined shapes, which fail to capture the dynamic nature of biological systems. To bridge this gap, TopoSPAM employs a topologically-informed, multi-scale simulation framework, shifting away from the constraints of static shapes to a more versatile, dynamic model.

The primary strength of TopoSPAM lies in its ability to harness the potential of topology in organizing shape and dynamical outcomes, providing an innovative solution for dimensionality reduction. With its user-friendly interface, TopoSPAM offers a robust set of tools and advancements for studying a variety of systems, from active nematic gels to 3D vertex models of tissues. These features allow for the examination of topological-defect-driven shape dynamics, a critical area often overlooked in traditional models.

TopoSPAM stands out not just for its versatility but also for its capacity to capture emergent flows and shapes across different scales. The inclusion of simulation capabilities for spring-lattice dynamics further expands its potential applications. By providing the tools to closely model and analyze the intricacies of morphogenesis and biological active matter, TopoSPAM is poised to significantly contribute to the understanding, diagnosis, and projection of individual medical cases, and may ultimately catalyze the progress of personalized approaches to medical treatment.
